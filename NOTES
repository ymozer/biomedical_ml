 Find a medical image segmentation dataset.
2- Use small size of the dataset [10 images]

3- Use feature extraction filters (LBP, GLCM, GFB, canny, sobel, .....) to create ML model. 
4- Train and test it with random forest, adaboost, ANN and xgboost
5- Save best performed model.
6- Show input and output images
7- Test model with a new image (un-trained)
